    <h1>NULL STATE: MISSION</h1>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Null State is an anti-fascist streetwear collective.</strong> We don't sell clothes to make money — we give them away to make noise. Our designs are weapons, our shirts are flyers, and every drop is a middle finger to systems of control. If you're tired of corporate liberalism, right-wing theocracy, or anyone profiting off oppression, you're home now.
    </p>

    <p>
      We don’t worship brands. We don’t follow trends. We are not for sale. Each drop is hand-printed and limited, but not exclusive. We use a <strong>$1 raffle system</strong> to fund the print run. Everyone who enters is guaranteed the shirt they select — no bullshit. And five entrants each round will receive a full 5-shirt pack. Randomly. No strings. No hierarchies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every drop supports a rotating cause — legal aid for protestors, bail funds, immigrant defense, trans mutual aid, or wherever the boot is landing hardest that week. We publish donation receipts in a public ledger so you always know where the money went. There is no secret backend. This is DIY activism with radical transparency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Null State is punk in execution, not just aesthetics. It’s for the disillusioned, the angry, the abandoned, the overeducated and underpaid, the burnt out, the fed up. Our only rule: <strong>make fascists afraid again.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      And if you're reading this — welcome to the state with no masters.
